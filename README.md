# Using shinylive in Quarto books

This repo is a test case for using shinylive (with R) to embed shiny in a [Quarto book](https://quarto.org/docs/books/) to provide simple visualizations. 

This is a work in progress and the APIs and methods will probably change (by becoming more simple and user-friendly) as time goes on. 

The source files are here. The rendered version is at the GitHub Pages site [`https://topepo.github.io/shinylive-in-book-test/`](https://topepo.github.io/shinylive-in-book-test/).
